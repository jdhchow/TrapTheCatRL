# TrapTheCatRL
A reinforcement learning algorithm to play Trap the Cat

Models/initialModel.h5 achieves a win rate of approximately 29% on a 5x5 (hexagonal) grid
with 60% initial tile fill without training. Models/initialModel.h5 was trained for
about 1000 epochs on initial tile fills between 20% and 70%. It has an approximately 75%
win rate.

There is lots of opportunity for improving the RL and cat movement algorithms.
