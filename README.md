# TrapTheCatRL
A reinforcement learning algorithm to play Trap the Cat

### Trap the Cat
Trap the Cat is a game played on an NxN board tiled with hexagons. The tiles can
be in one of two states: empty and filled. The game begins with a cat at the
centre. Each turn it moves an empty, adjacent tile. The player's objective is to
prevent the cat from leaving the board. On their turn, they can fill any
empty tile that does not contain the cat. The game ends when the cat reaches the
edge of the board or cannot move.

### Reinforcement Learning
The Model/ folder contains some trained models for the player and cat to
play on a 5x5 grid. There are many opportunities to improve the current
algorithms and refactor the code.
